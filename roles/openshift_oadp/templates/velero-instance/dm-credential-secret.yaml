# For each BackupStorageLocation, OADP operator generates a secret (velero-1-volsync-restic) that
# includes credentials used by the restic DataMover to connect to the S3 storage. Only
# RESTIC_PASSWORD can and must be defined by the user.
# See also https://volsync.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/restic/index.html#specifying-a-repository
# Unfortunately, it is not possible to use a custom trusted CA certificate at this time.
