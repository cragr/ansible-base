    # Available profiles:
    #
    # 'Default' Logs only metadata for read and write requests; does not log request bodies except
    # for OAuth access token requests. This is the default policy.
    #
    # 'WriteRequestBodies' In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for
    # every write request to the API servers (create, update, patch). This profile has more resource
    # overhead than the Default profile.
    #
    # 'AllRequestBodies' In addition to logging metadata for all requests, logs request bodies for
    # every read and write request to the API servers (get, list, create, update, patch). This
    # profile has the most resource overhead.
    #
    # 'None' No requests are logged; even OAuth access token requests and OAuth authorize token
    # requests are not logged.
