      EKS cluster installed successfully.

      You can check the cluster version using 'KUBECONFIG={{ eks_cluster_install.config_dir }}/kubeconfig oc version'

      Note that for the above command to work, you have to have AWS CLI installed and configured with valid credentials in ~/.aws/credentials
